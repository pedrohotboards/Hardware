Eagle Compenent libraries exclusive for Hotboards.

Here you can find an extensive collection of libraries with 
its corresponding footprints and thanks to the new eagleUp 
plugin its corresponding 3d model. These parts are exclusive designed by
StackBlocks and only work for the Eagle Cadsoft software and Google Sketchup.

The bank is grouped into manufacturers and then subdivided into
libraries to group specific devices, for instances, we have the
Freescale folder, so we can find libraries suchs as hsc08,
accelerometers or kinetis MCU.

Every time you want to create a new part, is mandatory to check 
if the manufacturer already existed in the file structure if not
it should be created and so on with its corresponding group of 
library
