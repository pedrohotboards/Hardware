ABRACON CORPORATION was established August 5, 1992 with the vision of becoming a top tier global manufacturer of Frequency Control, Signal Conditioning, Clock Distribution, and Magnetic Components with local design and technical support. In pursuit of this vision, Abracon has obtained ISO9001-2008 quality certification, made select equity investments in off-shore manufacturing facilities and installed quick-turn prototyping capabilities for custom magnetics and programmables at its California headquarters. Additionally, Abracon formed strategic, long term partnerships with off-shore manufacturing operations in order to share manufacturing expertise, advanced technology, capital investments and overall cost benefits obtained by outsourced production.
