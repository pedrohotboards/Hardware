E-Switch, Inc. is a switch supplier whose product offerings continue to expand each year with new product introductions that cater to market niches. Customer demand has prompted the addition of several new products, including new lines of snap-action switches; slide switches; sealed, illuminated pushbutton switches; SMT pushbutton switches; and illuminated rocker switches. Healthy sales growth has also precipitated the relocation of E-Switch corporate headquarters into a state-of-the-art facility in Minneapolis Minnesota. The 100,000 square foot building provides fantastic manufacturing, quality control, warehouse, and shipping capabilities.
